            Hello, World! My name is Christopher Sanchez and I am a Junior Computer Science Major at the 
            <a href = "https://www.csi.cuny.edu/">College of Staten Island</a>. I hope to enter the field of Software Engineering
            as a backend developer to both apply and expand my current programming knowledge. Over my time at CSI, I have gotten profecient
            at many different programming languages and development tools and hope to continue developing them during the remainder of my 
            time here.
        </p>

            I am most profecient at C++, having programmed with it since my Freshman year at CSI. I learned Python independently
            and continue to learn different ways to apply it to personal projects such as GUI design with GUIZero and games with PyGame. Additionally,
            I have used both Unity and different Version Controls for both 2D and XR game development and have begun to learn database management with
            MySQL.
